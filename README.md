# My dotfiles for macos

This repository contains my configuration dotfiles for macos. Sensitive parts of the config have been encrypted using [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt) (Note to self: use git-crypt unlock after you clone this repository). 

I have a separate dotfile repository for my config files in linux ([this one](https://github.com/AbstractGeek/my-dotfiles-linux)), although I don't update it often anymore.
